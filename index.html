				<h1>Hello friends and family!</h1>
				<p>
					Thanks for supporting me in this short term missions trip to LOGAN Hope. I hope to keep you all updated with my experience preparing and going on the missions trip over the next few months. So let’s see…

				<h1>How’s Life?</h1>
				<p>
					I’ll be graduating from Penn this year in May, and I’ll be moving to the Bay Area to start working as a software engineer in September. Graduating so soon is extremely bittersweet for me. I’ve enjoyed and grown in my time in college tremendously, in no small part thanks to the community of faith I found at Grace Covenant Church (GCC).

				<h1>Why missions?</h1>
				<p>
					Throughout my faith journey in the past few years, though I’ve grown immensely, I’ve also struggled with so many questions. One that hit hard over winter break was - <em><strong>what exactly is my faith?</strong></em> It’s a question that is so fundamental yet so hard to put into concrete terms. To me, one way to articulate it is that it’s a confluence of intellectual understanding, experiential convictions, and a life changed to live according to His will. And one aspect of faith that’s especially hit me recently is that it is also <em><strong>a choice.</strong></em> In particular, it is not only a choice to hold a Christian worldview and believe in Jesus Christ, but also an active choice to obey Him. So the primary answer to ‘why missions’ is truthfully a simple one - it’s my choice to obey His command to share the Gospel and love others.

				<h1>What is LOGAN Hope?</h1>
				<p>
					LOGAN Hope is a Christ-centered K-8 school for under-resourced children in the Logan neighborhood of Philadelphia. In particular, the majority of the neighborhood demographic is made up of Cambodian refugee families. Brief history: between 1975-1979, Cambodia went through a genocide under a communist insurgent group, the Khmer Rouge. 25% of the Cambodian population was wiped out, and many refugees fled in the face of the genocide. The families that came to the U.S. escaped the genocide, but in America now face extreme issues in lack of education, poverty, assimilation, and health.

						Recently, I watched an extremely poignant memoir film on the Khmer Rouge regime, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_They_Killed_My_Father_(film)' target='_blank'>First They Killed My Father</a> (directed by Angelina Jolie - you should all go watch it). It’s the sort of film that you need to sit and digest for hours after watching it. It painted a visceral image of the pain and trauma that occurred under the Khmer Rouge. After learning about the background of these Cambodian refugee families, I’m grateful to God that what began as a choice of obedience has steadily been growing into a genuine heart of love for the missions trip and the people of LOGAN Hope.

					<h1>Partnership</h1>
					<p>
							I sincerely appreciate each of you supporting me on this trip. If you signed up simply out of curiosity, thanks for taking the time to read (or let’s be real, skim) my letters! If you’d like to take an active role in partnership, prayers and financial support would be appreciated :)
					</p>
					<h2>Prayer</h2>
					<p>
							My main prayer request is that our team’s heart would really yearn to love the children and neighborhood of LOGAN Hope. And also that each of us not see this mission’s trip as an experience for selfish gain, but for serving His kingdom.
					</p>
					<h2>Finances</h2>
					<p>
							The trip’s cost is $500, which will be used for transportation, housing, food, and materials.
							If you’re a member of GCC, contributions can be made through our new GCC Philly mobile app.
							If you’re not from GCC, here’s a link to contribute.
